# LLMs

ðŸ”· Welcome to the LLM Projects Repository!

This repository is a collection of projects showcasing the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models. These projects, built in my free time, explore various frontier LLM APIs and ML applications, from chatbots to text summarization and more.

Whether you're interested in AI experiments, looking for inspiration, or just exploring what LLMs can do, you'll find exciting use cases here!

All projects using closed-source models, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, require an API key to be included in the project directory on your local machine.
